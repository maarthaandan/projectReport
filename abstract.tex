With the current surge in popularity of image-based applications, improving content quality is vital. Single Image Super-Resolution involves increasing the size of a small image while keeping the attendant drop in quality to a minimum. The task has numerous applications, including in satellite and aerial imaging analysis where  the total area of the land on Earth is so large and because resolution is relatively high, satellite databases are huge and image processing (creating useful images from the raw data) is time-consuming. Other applications include medical image processing, compressed image/video enhancement and facial image analysis, text image analysis, sign and number plates reading, and biometrics recognition, to name a few.

Our objective is to take a low-resolution image and produce an estimate of a corresponding high-resolution image. This problem is difficult : multiple high-resolution images can be produced from the same low-resolution image. For instance, suppose we have a 2x2 pixel sub-image containing a small vertical or horizontal bar. Regardless of the orientation of the bar, these 4 pixels will correspond to just one pixel in a picture downscaled 4 times. With real-life images, one needs to overcome an abundance of similar problems, making the task difficult to solve.
