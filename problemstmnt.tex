\chapter{Problem Statement}
Image super resolution is a problem that has always attracted the attention of software engineers and scientists. As a result there has been many methods addressing the problem including mathematical solutions like Bicubic interpolation and several neural networks solutions. But a central problem remains largely unsolved in all these cases: how to recover the minute texture details while super resolving?

The existing mathematical methods are based on interpolations which results in images with overly smooth edges and least perceptul appeal and the neural networks address the problem by focusing on minimising the Mean Square Error (MSE) loss wherein the resulting image has higher signal to noise ratio but lacks the fidelity expected at the higher resolution.
